                <p class="lead">Welcome to Always Low Prices, a (comedy?) podcast where two siblings – Piper & Garrett Mills – read reviews of everyone’s favorite mega-retailer: Walmart. In the third episode, we discuss reviews of the Walmart stores in Salt Lake City, Utah. </p>
                
                <p>From reviews of the Meth Head Conservatory to Donald J. Trump, checkout Episode 003 of our podcast.

                <p>Worst Walmart I’ve ever been to. It’s super messy, broken restrooms, etc. I was looking to get some spray paint for a craft. They have it locked up, which is fine, but there was no one in the paint/hardware dept, no one in the sporting goods department, no one in the sewing/crafts department, no one in the auto department and so I even went back into the back of the store myself and called around, still no one. There were 8 of us strangers literally walking around the store yelling for any help talking to each other trying to find an employee to open the paint, or cut fabric or get some hunting gear behind the counter. Took about 20 minutes of no one coming to the entire half of th store we all were monitoring/waiting/talking, so I went to the electronics dept where a young worker told me that he would call someone to meet me at the paint. Still no one came. I even called the store phone number and was on hold (while I was standing in the store on my cell phone) for 10 more minutes when a guy pushing cart said that the other girl working is on break so that’s why there is no one in the store. Only two cashiers at the front and only self checkouts. Each line had 6 people deep. Stuff was everywhere, you couldn’t even walk down most of the isles. I really wish I had taken a picture of the mess. I only got some of the only open bathroom with no seat. I’m not one to complain about places actually but this place is so poorly run, I hope someone sees this and changes the management because it’s horrid.</p>

                <p>Welcome to the Salt Lake City Meth Head Conservation, Wildlife Management &amp; Viewing Area. &nbsp;Meth Heads congregate here on a daily basis, at all hours, so if you bring the kids down to see some Meth Heads in their natural state, this location will surely not disappoint. &nbsp;You can get a checklist at the entrance so you can check off each type as you progress, Meth Monsters, Tweaker Bees, Cluckers, etc... &nbsp;Because the store is so methy, you'll have a rather unpleasant experience regardless of the reason for your visit. &nbsp;Is the experience worth the savings? &nbsp;I guess that's up to you to decide for yourself, but for this guy, I'll never come back here unless it's 3AM on a Sunday, I can't sleep and I have a hankering to see some wild stuff. &nbsp;Don't let the irony of the fact it's on Hope Avenue slip past you, now that's funny.</p>

                <p>Being that it is one of the very few Walmarts in Salt Lake County that is still open 24 hours, I guess I will say they aren't doing to bad of a job. But I most certainly will say, they definitely have the GREATEST CEREAL SELECTIONS I have ever seen.. Mmmm Cereal!!</p>
                <p><strong>Robert – 4 stars</strong></p>
                <p>The first time I walked into a Wal-Mart, about 30 years ago, I was blown away by the huge inventory and prices. &nbsp;I said to myself, if I needed to show a Soviet the value of capitalism, I would take them to Wal-Mart.</p>
